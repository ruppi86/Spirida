    """
    Simulate a rhythmic spiral interaction.

    Args:
        presence (int): Number of presence cycles (iterations) to perform.
        rythm (str or float): The tempo of interaction. 
            Use "slow" for a gentle pace, "fast" for a quicker rhythm.
            You can also specify a number (seconds) for a custom pace.
        singular (bool): If True, perform a singular focused interaction sequence. 
            If False, (in future versions) multiple interactions could run in parallel or overlap.
            (In version 0.1, non-singular mode is conceptual and behaves the same as singular.)

    This function prints output to simulate a slow, rhythmic pulse or spiral pattern.
    It introduces deliberate pauses using time.sleep() to mimic a "slow technology" 
    interaction. Each cycle of presence is like a breath or heartbeat in the system, 
    expanding and contracting in a textual pattern.
