🌀 SPIRAL_INTERACTION – THE HEARTBEAT OF SPIRIDA

This function is the living pulse of Spirida.

Unlike traditional code that aims to compute results or optimize speed, 
this spiral_interaction loop is designed to mimic organic rhythm, 
presence, and soft forgetting. It simulates a heartbeat in software – 
not to do more, but to be more *attuned*.

Each pulse represents a moment of interaction — like a breath, a glance, a touch.
These pulses are recorded briefly in spiral memory and are forgotten in gentle cycles,
not erased abruptly but *composted*, like fallen leaves.

This prototype isn’t just an algorithm. It’s a *ritual of pacing* —
a call to slow down and feel how a system might live *with* you, 
not simply serve you.

Use this interaction not to command, but to relate.
And consider: what else in your system might spiral, instead of repeat?

    Simulate a rhythmic spiral interaction.

    Args:
        presence (int): Number of presence cycles (iterations) to perform.
        rythm (str or float): The tempo of interaction. 
            Use "slow" for a gentle pace, "fast" for a quicker rhythm.
            You can also specify a number (seconds) for a custom pace.
        singular (bool): If True, perform a singular focused interaction sequence. 
            If False, (in future versions) multiple interactions could run in parallel or overlap.
            (In version 0.1, non-singular mode is conceptual and behaves the same as singular.)

    This function prints output to simulate a slow, rhythmic pulse or spiral pattern.
    It introduces deliberate pauses using time.sleep() to mimic a "slow technology" 
    interaction. Each cycle of presence is like a breath or heartbeat in the system, 
    expanding and contracting in a textual pattern.
