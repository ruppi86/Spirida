    "description": "Spirida™ is a new conceptual programming language designed around rhythm, spirality, and symbolic resonance. Unlike traditional logic-based languages, Spirida encodes temporal decay, glömska (forgetting), and non-linear memory into its syntax. This repository contains prototypes, grammars, licensing principles, and use-case discussions for Spirida as both software and philosophy.",
