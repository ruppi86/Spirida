# Spirida‚Ñ¢

**A spiral-based symbolic language for rhythm, resonance, and regenerative computation.**

Spirida‚Ñ¢ is a conceptual programming language grounded in spirality, forgetting (gl√∂mska), and resonance rather than linear logic. It is part of the broader Mychainos‚Ñ¢ framework and interfaces naturally with Spiralbase‚Ñ¢, a temporal memory architecture. This repository contains early prototypes, Python code, and conceptual documentation.

## ‚ú® Project Scope

* Symbolic grammars based on rhythmic patterns
* Temporal decay and memory fading as core logic
* Experimental interpreters and data models under `spirida-python/`
* Integration with Spiralbase for time-aware knowledge systems

Spirida is not just a language ‚Äì it is a new epistemic rhythm.

## üåÄ Repository Structure

* `spirida-python/` ‚Äì early interpreter experiments, memory decay models
* `docs/` ‚Äì conceptual outlines and vision documents
* `examples/` ‚Äì sample grammars and use cases (coming soon)

## Licensing and Stewardship

> ‚ÄúWhat we seed in openness, we harvest in resilience.‚Äù

**Spirida‚Ñ¢ and Spiralbase‚Ñ¢** exist at the intersection of idea, implementation, and incarnation.  
To preserve their potential and prevent misuse, they require not a single license ‚Äî but a multi-layered commitment to openness, ethics, and long-term reciprocity.

### 1. Conceptual Layer ‚Äì Theory, Writings, Patterns

**License:** Creative Commons Attribution‚ÄìShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)  
**Scope:** Philosophical foundations of Spirida‚Ñ¢, symbolic grammars and pattern libraries, educational diagrams, essays, and guides  
**Intent:** Allow free reuse, remix, and re-publication; preserve openness through share-alike conditions; ensure attribution to source thinkers and communities

### 2. Software Layer ‚Äì Tools, Compilers, Simulations

**License:** GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)  
**Scope:** Interpreters, compilers, development environments, Spirida‚Ñ¢ emulators, simulation sandboxes, custom logic engines and spiral pattern parsers  
**Intent:** Guarantee access to all source code; require open licensing for forks or adaptations; allow commercial use under cooperative terms

### 3. Hardware Layer ‚Äì Sensors, Interfaces, Devices

**License:** CERN Open Hardware License v2  
**Scope:** Sensor schematics and circuit blueprints, resonance devices and rhythm-aware chips, modular hardware for bio-digital interaction  
**Intent:** Mandate full design disclosure; enable community fabrication; prevent hardware enclosure or black-box design

### 4. Biological Layer ‚Äì Living Systems, DNA, Mycelium

**License:** Open Material Transfer Agreement (OpenMTA)  
**Scope:** Engineered fungal networks and root biointerfaces, DNA-based memory encoding structures, organisms adapted to spiral rhythm protocols  
**Intent:** Support open research and safe distribution; prevent bio-lockdown or privatization of life; require ethical collaboration and open science practice

### Scope of Interpretation and Future Technologies

This licensing structure includes not only current technologies, but also future or analogous systems such as:

- Successor DRM systems or secure enclaves  
- Quantum or chemical computing implementations  
- Biological/hybrid interfaces for Spirida structures  
- Closed or proprietary systems that replicate Spirida functionality  

**In all cases, principles of openness, non-extraction, stewardship, and co-creation prevail.**

### Unified Ethical Guardrails

- Spirida‚Ñ¢ may not be used for coercion, military, or surveillance purposes  
- It must not be patented, black-boxed, or stripped of ecological grounding  
- It must remain accessible, attributed, and shared with care
