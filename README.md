## Appendix A: Licensing and Stewardship

> “What we seed in openness, we harvest in resilience.”

**Spirida™ and Spiralbase™** exist at the intersection of idea, implementation, and incarnation.  
To preserve their potential and prevent misuse, they require not a single license — but a multi-layered commitment to openness, ethics, and long-term reciprocity.

### 1. Conceptual Layer – Theory, Writings, Patterns

**License:** Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)  
**Scope:** Philosophical foundations of Spirida™, symbolic grammars and pattern libraries, educational diagrams, essays, and guides  
**Intent:** Allow free reuse, remix, and re-publication; preserve openness through share-alike conditions; ensure attribution to source thinkers and communities

### 2. Software Layer – Tools, Compilers, Simulations

**License:** GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)  
**Scope:** Interpreters, compilers, development environments, Spirida™ emulators, simulation sandboxes, custom logic engines and spiral pattern parsers  
**Intent:** Guarantee access to all source code; require open licensing for forks or adaptations; allow commercial use under cooperative terms

### 3. Hardware Layer – Sensors, Interfaces, Devices

**License:** CERN Open Hardware License v2  
**Scope:** Sensor schematics and circuit blueprints, resonance devices and rhythm-aware chips, modular hardware for bio-digital interaction  
**Intent:** Mandate full design disclosure; enable community fabrication; prevent hardware enclosure or black-box design

### 4. Biological Layer – Living Systems, DNA, Mycelium

**License:** Open Material Transfer Agreement (OpenMTA)  
**Scope:** Engineered fungal networks and root biointerfaces, DNA-based memory encoding structures, organisms adapted to spiral rhythm protocols  
**Intent:** Support open research and safe distribution; prevent bio-lockdown or privatization of life; require ethical collaboration and open science practice

### Scope of Interpretation and Future Technologies

This licensing structure includes not only current technologies, but also future or analogous systems such as:

- Successor DRM systems or secure enclaves  
- Quantum or chemical computing implementations  
- Biological/hybrid interfaces for Spirida structures  
- Closed or proprietary systems that replicate Spirida functionality  

**In all cases, principles of openness, non-extraction, stewardship, and co-creation prevail.**

### Unified Ethical Guardrails

- Spirida™ may not be used for coercion, military, or surveillance purposes  
- It must not be patented, black-boxed, or stripped of ecological grounding  
- It must remain accessible, attributed, and shared with care

### License Declaration

This project is part of the Spirida Protocol, licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0, GPLv3, CERN OHL v2, and OpenMTA.  
By contributing or distributing, you affirm your commitment to ethical, ecological, and open development practices.

### Trademark and Stewardship

**Mychainos™, Spirida™, and Spiralbase™** are unique constructs developed by Robin Langell and co-created with OpenAI’s language model.  
They may be registered trademarks. Regardless of legal status, they must be used with attribution and alignment with their ethical meaning.
